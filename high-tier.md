I am creating an application here. I can bring in LinkedIn connections. I can see their comments. I can see their posts. I can post on their comments. I can comment on their comments. I can AI generate comments and post them on their posts. I have a LinkedIn content page, which is my own content. I can see the comments on my posts and then I can research. The people that have commented on my posts to see if they're in ICP and whether I want to engage with them. Then an action intelligence page where I can research people and research what content they are creating online. They have written articles, blog posts, etc. Significant LinkedIn posts are about people development and talent management. I can also pull in companies data from Salesforce. So I have their company data, all the calls that we've done with them, the transcripts that are inside of Salesforce. I can pull in that data and do research with it. So that's kind of where I'm at right now with this build.
