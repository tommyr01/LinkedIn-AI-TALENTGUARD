   - Analyzes external articles and thought leadership content

2. **LinkedIn Deep Analysis** (`/src/lib/linkedin-deep-analysis.ts`)
   - Analyzes LinkedIn articles, posts, and activity patterns
   - Extracts authority signals and expertise indicators
   - Assesses content consistency and practical experience

3. **Connection Intelligence Service** (`/src/lib/connection-intelligence-service.ts`)
   - Combines web and LinkedIn research results
   - Calculates unified expertise scores
   - Generates intelligence assessments with confidence levels

### Database Schema

Extended schema in `/src/lib/database-schema-intelligence.sql`:

- `web_research_results` - External research findings
- `linkedin_deep_analysis` - LinkedIn content analysis  
- `connection_intelligence_profiles` - Combined intelligence profiles
- `batch_research_requests` - Batch processing tracking
- `expertise_signals` - Individual expertise indicators
- `web_articles` - Extracted article content

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/intelligence/research` - Single connection research
- `POST /api/intelligence/batch` - Batch research processing
- `GET /api/intelligence/connections` - Available connections for research

## üîç Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Web Research (Perplexity + Firecrawl)
1. Generate targeted search queries for different expertise areas
2. Execute comprehensive web searches using Perplexity
3. Extract clean content from found articles using Firecrawl
4. Analyze content for expertise signals and authority indicators
5. Score expertise across talent management, people development, HR technology

### Phase 2: LinkedIn Deep Analysis
1. **Article Analysis**: Extract and analyze published LinkedIn articles
2. **Post Pattern Analysis**: Evaluate content consistency, original insights, practical examples
3. **Activity Analysis**: Study commenting behavior, content sharing patterns, network composition
4. **Profile Analysis**: Career progression, skills validation, credentials assessment

### Phase 3: Unified Intelligence
1. Combine web and LinkedIn scores with weighted algorithm
2. Cross-verify expertise claims against evidence
3. Identify red flags and strengths
4. Generate actionable recommendations
5. Assign verification status (verified/likely/unverified)

## üìä Scoring System

### Expertise Categories
- **Talent Management** (0-100): Talent acquisition, retention, succession planning
- **People Development** (0-100): Leadership development, coaching, training
- **HR Technology** (0-100): HRIS, analytics, automation platforms
- **Leadership** (0-100): Strategic leadership, organizational development

### Authority Indicators
- **Practical Experience**: Evidence of hands-on implementation
- **Thought Leadership**: Original insights and frameworks
- **Industry Recognition**: Engagement levels and speaking opportunities
- **Content Consistency**: Alignment between claims and published content

### Verification Levels
- **Verified (80%+ confidence)**: Strong external validation + consistent LinkedIn content
- **Likely (60-79% confidence)**: Some validation with good consistency
- **Unverified (<60% confidence)**: Limited evidence or inconsistent content

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Supabase database with LinkedIn connections
2. Perplexity API access (via MCP integration)
3. Firecrawl API access (via MCP integration)

### Database Setup
1. Run the schema extensions:
```sql
-- Execute the SQL in /src/lib/database-schema-intelligence.sql
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# Existing Supabase config
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key

# New: MCP tool configurations would go here
# (Specific to your MCP setup)
```

### Usage

#### Single Connection Research
```typescript
import { connectionIntelligenceService } from '@/lib/connection-intelligence-service'

const profile = await connectionIntelligenceService.generateIntelligenceProfile(connectionId)
```

#### Batch Research
```typescript
const batchResult = await connectionIntelligenceService.processBatch({
  connectionIds: ['id1', 'id2', 'id3'],
  priorityOrder: 'expertise_potential',
  maxConcurrency: 2
})
```

#### Dashboard Access
Navigate to `/dashboard/intelligence` to use the interactive research dashboard.
