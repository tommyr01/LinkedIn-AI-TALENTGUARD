      "Summary": "EthosEnergy has experienced significant corporate developments in 2024-2025. Most notably, One Equity Partners acquired the company for $138 million in January 2025, completing the transaction on December 31, 2024. Previously, EthosEnergy was jointly owned by Wood PLC (51%) and Siemens Energy AG (49%). This acquisition represents a major ownership change and potential growth capital injection.\n\nRecent business expansion includes the May 2025 acquisition of New York-based Turbine Services, Ltd., a specialized manufacturer of aftermarket parts for heavy-duty gas and steam turbines. The company has also secured several major contracts: a multi-year O&M agreement with Rhode Island State Energy Center (July 2025), an O&M contract for Manzanillo Power Land Project (May 2025), and a milestone O&M contract with Raban Al Safina Group in Iraq (May 2025).\n\nEthosEnergy has formed strategic partnerships, including a 2024 joint venture with RAS Group in Iraq for gas turbine component repair facilities, and a partnership with EagleBurgmann for enhanced compressor solutions (December 2024). The company is actively expanding in the Middle East with operations in Iraq and UAE, strengthening its Asia-Pacific presence in Malaysia and Thailand, and maintaining European operations.\n\nUnder CEO Ana Amicarella's leadership, the company is focusing heavily on energy transition solutions including hydrogen-ready technologies, geothermal power expansion, nuclear power services, waste-to-energy solutions, and remote operations digitalization. The company employs approximately 3,600 people globally and is positioning itself as a leading independent service provider for rotating equipment in the energy sector.\n",
